# Knative Function: rights-give

This Knative function, `rights-give`, is a core component of the `corekit-service-authorization` microservice. Its primary responsibility is to facilitate the granting and updating of access rights for entities to specific resources within the CoreKit ecosystem.

**Functionality:**
- **Input:** It accepts an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload conforming to the `GiveRightsRequest` structure. This request specifies the `Entity` (a UUID) to which rights are being granted, and a map of `Rights`, where each key is a resource identifier (UUID string) and the value is a `Right` object detailing the permissions (read, write, delete, share, custom, usage metrics, asset type, active status, and creation timestamp) for that resource.
- **Processing:** Upon receiving a valid request, the function interacts with the underlying PostgreSQL database via the Authorization Data Access Layer (DAL). It performs an `INSERT` operation with `ON CONFLICT (uid) DO UPDATE` semantics, ensuring that existing rights are updated and new rights are created atomically within a database transaction.
- **Output:** It returns an HTTP 200 OK response with a JSON payload representing a `GiveRightsResponse`. This response indicates the `Entity` for which rights were processed and a `Valid` boolean flag, along with an `Error` string if the operation was not successful.

This function is crucial for dynamically managing permissions and ensuring that entities have the necessary access to perform their designated operations.
